Introduction
============
py3o is an elegant and scalable solution to design
reports using OpenOffice.
py3o.template is the templating component that takes care of
merging your datasets with a corresponding templated OpenOffice document.

It is plateform independant and does not require OpenOffice itself to generate an ODF file.
If you want to generate a PDF or any other support output format you will then need to have
a server with OpenOffice and to install the py3o.renderserver on it.
